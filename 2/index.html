  <h4>Name:</h4> <p>Nathan Simon</p>
  <h4>Descriptor:</h4> <p>Nathan Simon is a engineer with NASA, and is interested in investing in our company.</p>
  <h4>Quote:</h4> <p>I believe in the future of an independent and prosperous space agency, free from the burden of bureaucracy.</p>
  <h4>Who is it?:</h4> <p>Mr. Simon is a 36 year old engineer currently employed by NASA. He currently lives in the Houston, TX area, but is willing to move to work with Outer State.</p>
  <h4>What Goals?:</h4> <p>Mr. Simon is dedicated to the idea that one day, private industry will be able to take over the space transportation market, and leave government run agencies to other projects.</p>
  <h4>What Attitude?:</h4> <p>Luckily for us, he is eager to help support the growing market of space transportation and is focused on making sure it becomes a sustained market for years to come.</p>
  <h4>What Behavior?:</h4> <p>Organized, likes efficiency, and not a fan of messy/confused design layouts. If we want to land him, we must make the website easy to use and make the message standout. He’s easily distracted when using websites, which is a damn shame considering he’s a dedicated engineer.</p>
