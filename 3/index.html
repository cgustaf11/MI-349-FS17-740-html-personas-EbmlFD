  <h4>Name:</h4> <p>Charles Flowers</p>
  <h4>Descriptor:</h4> <p>Charles is..an evil businessman looking to profit off the misfortune of others</p>
  <h4>Quote:</h4> <p>Deep down, weâ€™re all evil in our own way, I just want to be rich</p>
  <h4>Who is it?:</h4> <p>Charles was raised in a normal family, but lost touch with his parents shortly after graduating high school. Luckily for him, he won the Ohio Lottery and amassed a fortune of over $200 million. Through poor decision making and the Great Recession, he lost it all, mainly due to poor real estate investments in Del Boca Vista.</p>
  <h4>What Goals?:</h4> <p>Regaining his fortune, at whatever cost necessary, no life worth saving, not even his own.</p>
  <h4>What Attitude?:</h4> <p>Views us as an opportunity to regain his former life, by exploiting the resources of other planets and asteroids in the local Solar System. Willing to invest in the company if it means he can one day be wealthy again.</p>
  <h4>What Behavior?:</h4> <p>Surprisingly proficient user of the web, and capable of learning on the go. Makes quick decisions, but usually does not stick with them. Prefers to use a mobile browser, as desktops tend to tie him down and make him an easy target for the authorities. Visits the site multiple times before finally making a decision that will persist.</p>
